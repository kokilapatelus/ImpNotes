Using CLI you can not create a specific angular version.

But you can install a specific version of angular CLI into a particular folder.

For Example:

First create new folder inside any drive. I'm going to create a demo folder in D drive. Ex: d:\projects\demo.

Then find this folder inside Command Prompt(cmd) or just type cmd into your created folder address bar in Windows and hit enter.

Now type angular specific version command: npm install @angular/cli@1.7.x for angular 5. and use a similar command for the other version.

After completing the installation, just create a new angular project in your specific folder that you recently installed angular. Ex: d:\projects\demo\.

Now create an angular project using the command npx ng new Project_name and it will create a your specific angular version Project.

In my example, it will create an angular 5 project.
