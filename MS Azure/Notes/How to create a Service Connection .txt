How to create a Service Connection in Azure Dev Ops

Azure Dev Ops  --> Project Setting (bottom left hand side) -->Service Connection (Bottom 4th or 5 left of Left Side Bar)-->New Service Connection-->Create New button

Now select Azure Resource Manager -->Service Principal (manual)

Now we need subscription Id for that go to portal.azure.com

and you will see subscription option on home page screen.

create a subscription if not created, it will generate subscription id and subscription name which will be required to create a service connection.  paste the subscription id and subscription name in the respective input field of service connection creation screen of devops portal.

Now it requires Service Principal Id, which we can search in Azure Portal with App Registration Option...

Click App Registration-->new app registration-->Select name and done.

Here Applicationid = Service Principal Id 
     DirectoryId = Tenent Id
copy and paste in service connection.


For Key Id go to Certificate & Secret in azure portal and generate Certificate.  
App Registration-->LeftSide Bar (Certificate & Secret)
certificate-->New client secret-->give some name--> Add

It will generate certificate for service connection.
    value = Service Principal Key

If we click on validate button it will be failed so we have to use 
IAM service for  that

Portal-->Subscription-->click on subscription-->IAM -->Add Role Assignment

Add Role Assignment-->Members(Tab)-->Select members

Search box give the app service name...select the checkbox..
Here, Members should be app name registered under App Registration Not a person name.

For Role select as a contributors.
