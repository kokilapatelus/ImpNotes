Basic idea is to create a empty repository and Link a local folder which will be sync with azure repo..  First we will clone azure blank repo and sync with local folder of our computer.

Once it is sync, then we have to copy all our target project file in to that local folder and then push our code to git flow copy-staging-commit-push which will result in to our code will be available on azure repository with folder structure.
